# Capstone_User_Interface_Project

  The online pharmacy app is the name of our web application. We all know that because of Covid-19, people are trying hard to stay socially distant. In the light of the world's current stance, I am proposing the online pharmacy app whose ultimate goal is to help people stay safe, especially those with underlying health conditions. This app will solve a few problems like preventing long waits in queues and going to crowded marketplaces. Through this app, customers will be able to order their medicine and get it delivered to their houses which is very convenient. And also it would be very beneficial to the old folks that cannot drive, to those that do not have a car, and to the people with physical handicaps. The app is designed to be very simple, very friendly-user. It will generate revenue and will create jobs.
